* v2.2.0    2017/01/31

- The new function ~epkg-provided-by~ returns the package that provides
  a given feature.  It replaces ~epkg--required~, which did the same
  thing, but also also guessed the package for certain features, those
  involving autoload, version, and test libraries, in case the Epkg
  database did not contain any information on the feature.  The new
  function doesn't do that because this is no longer necessary now
  that all those features are accounted for in the database.

- ~epkg-required~ is now defined as a generic function.  Previously,
  due to a copy-paste error, ~epkg-provided~ was instead defined as
  such twice.

* v2.1.0    2016/12/31

- Repository moved to https://github.com/emacscollective/epkg.

- A misguided kludge was removed from ~epkg-list-mode-hook~, which
  prevented customizations that were loaded before to ~epkg~ to have
  an effect.

- The manual was updated heavily.

* v2.0.0    2016/11/05

- Store Melpa recipes, GNU Elpa specs and lists of built-in libraries
  which belong to a package in Epkg objects.  The respective object
  slots and database columns and tables are named ~melpa-recipes~,
  ~gelpa-recipes and ~builtin-libraries~.

- Add new package type ~minority~, which is used for packages that are
  mirrored using ~curl~ even though upstream uses some vcs repository.
  This is necessary for unsupported vcs (everything except Git and
  Mercurial) and for extremely messy Git repositories.

- Repository moved to https://gitlab.com/emacscollective/epkg.

- Updated manual and made source compatible with Org v9.0.

- Improved and extended ~make~ targets.

* v1.0.0    2016/04/15

- Reincarnation release.
