* v2.1.0    2016/12/31

- Repository moved to https://github.com/emacscollective/epkg.

- A misguided kludge was removed from ~epkg-list-mode-hook~, which
  prevented customizations that were loaded before to ~epkg~ to have
  an effect.

- The manual was updated heavily.

* v2.0.0    2016/11/05

- Store Melpa recipes, GNU Elpa specs and lists of built-in libraries
  which belong to a package in Epkg objects.  The respective object
  slots and database columns and tables are named ~melpa-recipes~,
  ~gelpa-recipes and ~builtin-libraries~.

- Add new package type ~minority~, which is used for packages that are
  mirrored using ~curl~ even though upstream uses some vcs repository.
  This is necessary for unsupported vcs (everything except Git and
  Mercurial) and for extremely messy Git repositories.

- Repository moved to https://gitlab.com/emacscollective/epkg.

- Updated manual and made source compatible with Org v9.0.

- Improved and extended ~make~ targets.

* v1.0.0    2016/04/15

- Reincarnation release.
